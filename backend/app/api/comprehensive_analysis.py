Repayment will be made in consecutive monthly installments starting December 9, 2025 and continuing on the 9th of each month until November 9, 2030, when the final balance becomes due.

**INTEREST RATE RISK:** The 12% annual interest rate is within market standards for business loans but represents a significant financial commitment. Monthly compounding increases the effective rate slightly.

**REPAYMENT RISK:** The 5-year term provides adequate time for repayment, but monthly installments of approximately Rs. 1,11,000 require consistent cash flow management.

**PENALTY STRUCTURE:** The agreement includes reasonable late fee provisions (Rs. 1,000) with a 30-day grace period, which is borrower-friendly compared to industry standards.

**PREPAYMENT FLEXIBILITY:** The no-penalty prepayment clause is advantageous for the borrower, allowing early repayment if business conditions improve.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Maintain adequate cash reserves for monthly payments
2. Monitor business cash flow closely to avoid late payments  
3. Consider prepayment when surplus funds are available
4. Review loan terms annually for refinancing opportunities""",

The monthly rent of Rs. 5,000 plus Rs. 500 maintenance totaling Rs. 5,500 is reasonable for a two-bedroom property in Pollachi. The 25-month term provides stability for both parties.

**SECURITY DEPOSIT RISK:**
The Rs. 20,000 security deposit (approximately 3.6 months rent) is within standard range and provides adequate protection for the owner while remaining affordable for the tenant.

**TERMINATION PROVISIONS:**
The one-month notice period for termination is standard and fair. Both parties have equal rights to terminate, preventing one-sided control.

**MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES:**
Clear division of repair duties - tenant handles minor day-to-day repairs while owner covers structural and major repairs. This prevents disputes over responsibility.

**USAGE RESTRICTIONS:**
Strict residential-only usage and subletting prohibition protect the owner's interests and maintain property value.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Document property condition at move-in
2. Maintain records of all rent and maintenance payments
3. Provide written notice for any repairs needed

**CONFIDENTIALITY SCOPE ANALYSIS:**
The agreement covers comprehensive confidential information including technical data, business plans, and proprietary processes. The definition is broad but reasonable for protecting company interests during internship.

**TIME LIMITATION RISK:**
The 90-day confidentiality period is relatively short compared to industry standards (typically 2-5 years). This benefits the intern while providing adequate protection for immediate business needs.

**DISCLOSURE RESTRICTIONS:**
Clear prohibitions on sharing confidential information with third parties or using for personal benefit. The "need to know" limitation helps prevent unauthorized access within the organization.

**ENFORCEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:**
As an unpaid internship, enforcement mechanisms may be limited. The agreement lacks specific penalty clauses or liquidated damages provisions.

**REASONABLE CARE STANDARD:**
The requirement for "reasonable care" provides flexibility but may create ambiguity in determining adequate protection measures.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
1. Document all confidential information accessed during internship
2. Maintain clear boundaries between personal and internship-related activities
3. Seek clarification on what constitutes "confidential" when uncertain
4. Keep confidential materials secure and limit access as specified""",

வீட்டை பிணையமாக வைப்பது அதிக ஆபத்து. கடன் திருப்பிச் செலுத்த முடியாவிட்டால் வீட்டை இழக்க நேரிடலாம்.

**மாதாந்திர தவணை சுமை:**
₹15,750 மாதாந்திர தவணை நடுத்தர வருமானம் உள்ளவர்களுக்கு கணிசமான சுமையாக இருக்கலாம்.

**சட்ட அமலாக்கம்:**
தனியார் கடன் ஒப்பந்தம் என்பதால் வங்கி கடனை விட அமலாக்கத்தில் சிரமங்கள் இருக்கலாம்.

**பரிந்துரைகள்:**
1. மாதாந்திர வருமானத்தில் 30%க்கு மேல் தவணையாக செலுத்த வேண்டாம்
2. அபராத வட்டியை 1%க்கு குறைக்க பேச்சுவார்த்தை நடத்தவும்
3. அவசர நிலையில் முன்கூட்டியே கடனை அடைக்கும் விதிமுறைகளை சேர்க்கவும்""",
