# LegalLens

**LegalLens** is an AI-powered, privacy-focused assistant for legal document understanding and risk detection—designed for Indian law, official government dictionaries, and multilingual support.

  Legal terms and content are routed by a custom agent and MCP server to the appropriate database or knowledge graph for explanation and look-up.
- **Authoritative Legal Definitions:**  
  Definitions and relationships powered by the Ministry of Justice & Law dictionary, modeled as knowledge graphs in Cloud Spanner.
- **Indian Law Book Integration:**  
  Full text and indices of BNS, BNSS, BSA, Consumer Rights stored in AlloyDB, accessible through fast retrieval and vector search.
- **Lightning-fast Dictionary Explorer:**  
  Redis and Valkey provide instant caching for legal dictionaries and semantic embeddings (Gemma).
- **Real-Time Risk Alerts:**  
  (Coming Soon) NLP-powered agent instantly warns users of risky or unfair contract terms before signing.
- **Multilingual and Voice-Enabled:**  
  (Planned) Seamless support for all major Indian languages and voice chat via Google Translate/Voice APIs.
- **Uncompromising Security & Audit:**  
  Data protection by Firebase Auth, Google IAM, encryption via KMS, immutable blockchain audit with GCUL, and fully secure document storage.
- **Chatbot Interface:**  
  AI-powered chatbot presents contract summaries, term explanations, and rapid answers (built on Flutter + Python backend).
